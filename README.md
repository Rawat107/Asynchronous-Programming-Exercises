# Asynchronous Programming Exercises

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates various asynchronous programming techniques in JavaScript, including **callbacks, promises, and async/await**. Each technique is implemented in a separate HTML file, with JavaScript inside `<script>` tags. The project also includes **CSS styling** to enhance the user interface.

## Features
- **Callbacks:** Simulates a delay and fetches data from an API.
- **Promises:** Implements asynchronous API calls with loading states and error handling.
- **Async/Await:** Uses modern syntax for cleaner asynchronous code with proper error handling.
- **API Integration:** Fetches posts from [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/posts).
- **Styled UI:** Uses CSS for better presentation, including scrollable content and sticky headers.

## Files Structure
- `callbacks.html` – Implements asynchronous operations using callbacks.
- `promises.html` – Uses promises to handle asynchronous operations.
- `async-await.html` – Implements asynchronous operations using async/await.
- `styles/` – Contains CSS files for UI styling.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Rawat107/Asynchronous-Programming-Exercises.git
   ```
2. Open any of the HTML files in a browser to test the functionality.
